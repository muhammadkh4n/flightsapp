- RapidAPI account for flight data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MyFlightApp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
X_RapidAPI_Key=your_rapidapi_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

## Configuration

### Clerk Authentication
1. Create a Clerk application at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Get your publishable key from the Clerk dashboard
3. Add the key to your `.env` file

### RapidAPI Sky Scrapper
1. Subscribe to Sky Scrapper API on RapidAPI
2. Get your API key from the RapidAPI dashboard  
3. Add the key to your `.env` file

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Loading states and error messages
- Smooth navigation between screens

## API Integration

The app integrates with RapidAPI Sky Scrapper to provide:
- Airport search and IATA code lookup
- Flight search between airports
- Real-time pricing and availability

## Development

Created as part of a mobile app development assessment - turning Google Flights into a mobile app with user authentication.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
